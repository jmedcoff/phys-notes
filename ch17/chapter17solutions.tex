	\section{Preliminaries}
	
	From class, we have learned about electricity as it behaves in circuits: as electrical current. Current is related to resistance of circuit elements and voltage through Ohm's Law. Using this property, we can solve circuits involving resistors similar to how we did so for capacitors. Resistance is affected by the material used to construct the resistor, as well as the temperature of the resistor. We can also relate power to circuit components.
